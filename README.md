# C_Study
Studying basic C language, data structures, and algorithms.  
The materials are based on the book   
**쉽게 풀어쓴 C 언어 Express** by Cheon In-guk.  
I translate and summarize the contents, and also implement examples in code.  
Please note that some expressions may sound a bit awkward compared to books originally written in English.

## Purpose
This repository is for ... 
1. My personal learning record
2. A potential portfolio to showcase coding practice

## How to Compile
```bash
gcc -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 hello.c -o hello
./hello
```
