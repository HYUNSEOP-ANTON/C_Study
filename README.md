# C_Study
Studying basic C language, data structures and algorithms.  
The materials are based on the book   
**쉽게 풀어쓴 C 언어 Express** by Cheon In-guk.  
I translate and summarize the contents, and also implement examples in code.  
Please note that some expressions may sound a bit awkward compared to books originally written in English.

## Purpose
This repository is for ... 
1. My personal learning record
2. A potential portfolio to showcase coding practice
3. To get used to Git and GitHub
4. To get used to write documents with English

## The Structure of Repository
Each chapter contains notes, example code, labs, and exercises.

1. **Notes**: The theoretical part, explaining the concepts with some basic examples.
2. **Example Code**: Simple code snippets that demonstrate the concepts from the notes.
3. **Lab**: Practice problems that are a bit more advanced than the examples.
4. **Exercises**: End-of-chapter problems for additional practice.  

## How to Compile
Currently this repository is using mingw64 and VScode.  
To complie this sauce code   
1. `ctrl + shift + b` in VScode
